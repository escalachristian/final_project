NOTE ON PARTS THAT DON'T WORK

All the data in this prototype is hardcoded.
The search bar is not able to search for anything else rather than the items listed.
When the search bar is empty and press enter the recipes disappear (In that case the page needs to be refreshed)
The search bar only works on the home page. The search bar doesn't work on the recipe detail page.
