FoodGuru

Link: mysite.pratt.edu/~cescala

A website the user can search for recipes by ingredients they have in their fridge.


Changes made since the prototype
- On the detail recipe page, I added a section on the left side which has the filtered recipes from the search on the home page. The recipes on that section are related to the main recipe featured on the right.
- When somebody mispelled on the search bar beef, cheese, tuna or chicken, it will give an error message.

Task

Adam gets home late from a long day. He is hungry and opens the fridge, but he doesn't know what to cook with the ingredients he has. So, he opens app Food Guru app and looks for a recipe that interests him according to the main ingredients he has on his fridge.

Steps

- Type on search bar chicken or Chicken and press enter
- Type on search bar cheese or Cheese and press enter
- Type on search bar beef or Beef and press enter
- Type on search bar tuna or Tuna and press enter
- Click on any recipe that came out of the search by ingredient
- On the detail recipe page, scroll up and down on the related recipes section
- Click on any related recipe and the main recipe on the right will change image and title.
- Go home by clicking on the logo
- Mispell chicken on the search bar and it will give an error message
- Shrink the screen and try the tasks on the three breakpoints (desktop, tablet and mobile)

NOTE ON PARTS THAT DON'T WORK

- The food Api I was intended to use to retreive the data for the recipes didn't work. The Api was blocking to get the information, so I applied the example taught in class and read some tutorials which fixed the problem. However, that solution was giving me a syntax error which I was never able to figure out. I checked that myself and got some help, but couldn't work. So, I decided just to create my own jason data which is where my data (images, names of recipes, ingredients, rating) is coming from.
- All the data and code is hardcoded.
- The search bar is not able to search for anything else rather than the items listed.
